# Faculty Handler

## Overview
The Faculty Handler manages all faculty-related queries in the ObeAIâ„¢ system. It processes requests for faculty information by subject (who teaches a subject) and faculty teaching assignments (what subjects a faculty member teaches).

## File Location
`actions/handlers/faculty_handler.py`

## Dependencies
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Text
import logging
import re
import requests
import json
from actions.utils.database import get_db_connection, normalize_faculty_name
from actions.utils.database import extract_subject_name, extract_faculty_name

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet
```

## Main Class
```python
class ActionFacultyQuery(Action):
    """Handle all faculty-related queries"""
```

## Constants
```python
PDF_THRESHOLD = 5  # Number of results before generating PDF instead of direct message
```

## Helper Functions

    """
    Get faculty members teaching a specific subject

## Handler Methods

### 1. Faculty By Subject Handler
```python
def _handle_faculty_by_subject(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, entity_dict: Dict[str, Any], message: str) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
    """Handle queries for faculty by subject"""
    subject = entity_dict.get('subject')

            subject = subject_name
    
    if subject:
        faculty_list = get_faculty_for_subject(subject)
        if faculty_list:
            # Handle large result sets with PDF generation
            if len(faculty_list) > PDF_THRESHOLD:
                dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Found {len(faculty_list)} faculty members teaching {subject}.")

    else:
        dispatcher.utter_message(text="I couldn't identify a subject in your query. Please provide a subject name.")
    
    return []
```

### 2. Subjects By Faculty Handler
```python
def _handle_subjects_by_faculty(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, entity_dict: Dict[str, Any], message: str) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
    """Handle queries for subjects by faculty"""
    faculty_name = entity_dict.get('faculty_name')
    
    if not faculty_name:
        # Try to extract from message using utility function
        extracted_name = extract_faculty_name(message)
        if extracted_name:
            faculty_name = extracted_name
    
    if faculty_name:
        # Normalize faculty name for better matching
        faculty_name = normalize_faculty_name(faculty_name)
        
        subjects = get_subjects_for_faculty(faculty_name)
        if subjects:
            # Handle large result sets with PDF generation
            if len(subjects) > PDF_THRESHOLD:
                dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Found {len(subjects)} subjects taught by {faculty_name}.")
                
                # Generate PDF report
                pdf_url = self._generate_pdf_for_results(subjects, "faculty", faculty_name)
                if pdf_url:
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"I've prepared a PDF report with all the results. [Download PDF]({pdf_url})")
                else:
                    # Fallback to displaying limited results
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text="Here are the first few results:")
                    for subject in subjects[:PDF_THRESHOLD]:
                        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"- {subject.get('subject_name')} ({subject.get('subject_code')})")
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"... and {len(subjects) - PDF_THRESHOLD} more subjects.")
            else:
                # Display all results directly
                if len(subjects) == 1:
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"{faculty_name} teaches:")
                else:
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"{faculty_name} teaches multiple subjects:")
                
                for subject in subjects:
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"- {subject.get('subject_name')} ({subject.get('subject_code')})")
            
            return [SlotSet("faculty_name", faculty_name)]
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"No subjects found for faculty '{faculty_name}'. Please check the faculty name.")
    else:
        dispatcher.utter_message(text="I couldn't identify a faculty name in your query. Please provide a faculty name.")
    
    return []
```

### 3. Generic Query Handler
```python
def _handle_generic_faculty_query(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, message: str) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
    """Handle generic faculty queries using regex patterns"""
    
    # First try to identify subject queries
    subject_name = extract_subject_name(message)
    if subject_name:
        return self._handle_faculty_by_subject(dispatcher, {"subject": subject_name}, message)
    
    # Then try faculty name queries
    faculty_name = extract_faculty_name(message)
    if faculty_name:
        return self._handle_subjects_by_faculty(dispatcher, {"faculty_name": faculty_name}, message)
    
    # Fallback response if no patterns matched
    dispatcher.utter_message(text="I couldn't understand your faculty query. Please try again with more specific information.")
    return []
```

## Error Handling

### 1. Missing Information
```python
if not subject:
    dispatcher.utter_message(text="I couldn't identify a subject in your query. Please provide a subject name.")
    return []
```

### 2. No Results Found
```python
if not faculty_list:
    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"No faculty found teaching '{subject}'. Please check the subject name.")
```

### 3. Database Errors
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error fetching faculty for subject: {e}")
    return []
```

## PDF Generation

When result sets are large (exceeding `PDF_THRESHOLD` of 5), the system generates PDF reports:

1. The handler identifies a large result set
2. It calls `_generate_pdf_for_results()` to create a PDF
3. It returns a download link to the user
4. If PDF generation fails, it falls back to showing a limited set of results

```python
if len(faculty_list) > PDF_THRESHOLD:
    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Found {len(faculty_list)} faculty members teaching {subject}.")
    
    # Generate PDF report
    pdf_url = self._generate_pdf_for_results(faculty_list, "subject", subject)
    if pdf_url:
        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"I've prepared a PDF report with all the results. [Download PDF]({pdf_url})")
    else:
        # Fallback to showing limited results
        dispatcher.utter_message(text="Here are the first few results:")
        for faculty in faculty_list[:PDF_THRESHOLD]:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"- {faculty.get('name')} teaches {faculty.get('subject_name')} ({faculty.get('subject_code')})")
        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"... and {len(faculty_list) - PDF_THRESHOLD} more faculty members.")
```

## Example Usage

### 1. Faculty for Subject Query
```
User: "Who teaches Database Management Systems?"
Response: 
"Database Management Systems is taught by multiple faculty members:
- Dr. Akila V teaches Database Management Systems (CS305)
- 
```

### 2. Subjects for Faculty Query
```
User: "What subjects does Dr. Akila V teach?"
Response: 
"Dr.Akila V teaches multiple subjects:
- Database Management Systems (CS305)
- Advanced Database Concepts (CS505)
- Big Data Analytics (CS605)"
```

### 3. Query with Large Result Set
```
User: "Show all Computer Networks faculty"
Response: 
"Found 6 faculty members teaching Computer Networks.
I've prepared a PDF report with all the results. [Download PDF](http://localhost/B/AuraAI/pdf_reports/faculty_subject_Computer_Networks_20240607_123456.pdf)"
```

## Best Practices for Maintenance

1. **Pattern Handling**: When adding new patterns for entity extraction, ensure they handle common variations

2. **Database Query Building**: Maintain the careful approach to building SQL queries with appropriate parameters

3. **PDF Threshold**: Adjust the `PDF_THRESHOLD` value based on chat platform limitations and user experience needs

4. **Name Normalization**: Keep the faculty name normalization function updated as new naming patterns emerge

5. **Response Format**: Maintain consistent response formats for both single and multiple results
